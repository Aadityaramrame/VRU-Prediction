# üß† VRU Detection, Tracking & Forecasting using Transformers

## üìå Overview  
This project presents an **end-to-end pipeline for Vulnerable Road User (VRU) understanding** ‚Äî from detection and tracking to future trajectory prediction.  
It integrates **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Sequential Forecasting** to accurately **predict the next (X, Y) positions** of VRUs such as pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles using **Transformer-based models**.

## üö¶ Project Pipeline  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Detection ‚Äî *YOLO-based VRU Identification*  
- Multi-camera video input processed using **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection.  
- Each VRU (pedestrian, cyclist, vehicle) is localized with bounding boxes and class labels.  
- Depth estimation integrated to improve spatial awareness.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking ‚Äî *Multi-object Tracking with DeepSORT*  
- Detected VRUs are tracked across frames using **DeepSORT**, which combines motion and appearance features.  
- Each entity is assigned a **unique TRACK_ID** for continuous observation.  
- Tracking results are exported as CSV/Excel logs containing position and motion data.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering  
- Using the tracking logs, motion-based features are computed:
  - `delta_X`, `delta_Y` ‚Üí displacement  
  - `speed` ‚Üí velocity magnitude  
  - `direction` ‚Üí movement angle  
  - `delta_time` ‚Üí frame time difference  
  - `confidence` ‚Üí detection reliability  
- These features form the input for trajectory forecasting.  
- Output stored as: `final_features.xlsx`.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting ‚Äî *Transformer-based VRU Trajectory Prediction*  
- A **PyTorch Transformer model** predicts the next `(X, Y)` positions based on the past sequence of movements.  
- The model learns temporal patterns in VRU trajectories, offering robust short-term forecasts even under occlusions or noise.  
- Outputs include:
  - Predicted vs True next positions  
  - Visualization plots comparing trajectories
